SQL Challenge

The objective for this challenge was to create tables to hold the data from 6 csv files and create queries to analyze the data for a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard. 

Instructions:
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Modeling:
The instructions said to first inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. I actually ended up writing my code to build out my tables first to easier see what tables and columns there would be in my ERD. Familiarizing the data made it easier to sketch out my primary key.

Data Engineering:
Since my tables were already coded I then made adjustments to my code after I exported my ERD to a PostgreSQL file by adding primary keys as needed. I then imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. 

Data Analysis:
1.) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  -SELECT a.emp_no, a.last_name, a.first_name, a.sex, b.salary
  -FROM employees AS a
  -JOIN salaries AS b
  -ON a.emp_no = b.emp_no;

2.) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
  - SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
  -FROM employees
  -WHERE hire_date >= '1986-01-01'
  -AND hire_date <= '1986-12-31'
  -ORDER BY hire_date DESC;

3.) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  -SELECT a.dept_no, b.dept_name, c.emp_no, c.last_name, c.first_name
  -FROM dept_manager AS a
  -JOIN departments AS b
  -ON a.dept_no = b.dept_no
  -JOIN employees AS c
  -ON a.emp_no = c.emp_no;

  4.) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    -SELECT a.dept_no, c.emp_no, c.last_name, c.first_name, b.dept_name
    -FROM dept_employees AS a
    -JOIN departments AS b
    -ON a.dept_no = b.dept_no
    -JOIN employees AS c
    -ON a.emp_no = c.emp_no;

5.) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
    -SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
    -FROM employees
    -WHERE first_name = 'Hercules'
    -AND last_name LIKE 'B%';

6.) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
    -SELECT a.dept_name, b.emp_no, c.last_name, c.first_name
    -FROM employees AS c
    -JOIN dept_employees AS b
    -ON c.emp_no = b.emp_no
    -JOIN departments AS a
    -ON a.dept_no = b.dept_no
    -WHERE dept_name = 'Sales';

7.) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    -SELECT b.emp_no, c.last_name, c.first_name, a.dept_name
    -FROM employees AS c
    -JOIN dept_employees AS b
    -ON c.emp_no = b.emp_no
    -JOIN departments AS a
    -ON a.dept_no = b.dept_no
    -WHERE dept_name = 'Sales' OR dept_name = 'Development';

8.) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
    -SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS last_name_count
    -FROM employees
    -GROUP BY last_name
    -ORDER BY COUNT(last_name) DESC;
